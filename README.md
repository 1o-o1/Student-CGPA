# Student-CGPA
Predicting Students' CGPA from questionnaire using neural network approach 
Dropout is one of the most pressing problems for undergraduate students. To find out the
attributes which affected mostly to the students and predicted their academic results from
the questionnaire using neural networks such as Artificial Neural Network and RNN-LSTM.
the survey, there are questions about major illness, attendance, study hour, gender,
 group study, hostel staying, internet facilities, communication skills, self-income,
sports or cultural involvement, political involvement, scholarship, marital status, Secondary
School Certificate (SSC) result, Higher Secondary Certificate (HSC). There are total 4 categories of 
cgpa ranging from 0.00-2.99 to 3.75-4.00. 
Data pre-processing has been done through data cleaning, data labeling, and grouping from
the questionnaire which was submitted by the participants in a survey form.
LSTM-RNN model has got 85.63% but ANN-based model performed best with 89.34% accuracy in
this multi-class classification problem.
